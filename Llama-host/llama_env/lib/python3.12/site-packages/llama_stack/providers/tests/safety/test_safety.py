# How to run this test:
#
# 1. Ensure you have a conda with the right dependencies installed. This is a bit tricky
#    since it depends on the provider you are testing. On top of that you need
#    `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` installed.
#
# 2. Copy and modify the provider_config_example.yaml depending on the provider you are testing.
#
# 3. Run:
#
# ```bash
# PROVIDER_ID=<your_provider> \
#   PROVIDER_CONFIG=provider_config.yaml \
#   pytest -s llama_stack/providers/tests/safety/test_safety.py \
#   --tb=short --disable-warnings
# ```
